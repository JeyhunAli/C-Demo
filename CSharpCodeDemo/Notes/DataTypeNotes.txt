so the data types can be categorized into two categories based on how they occupy memory location.
So as the name suggests, it is a data type which, when declared and assigned a value, holds that

value directly on its own memory space.

All right.

So the value type uses heap to store value.
Example of value types are data types such as int float long double char bool decimal double.
And then if we look at the reference type in more detail, we can see that it is a variable type which

instead of storing the value in memory directly, stores only the memory location of actual data.

The variable here stores the memory reference of the data and not the data directly.

This is the huge difference, right?

So reference data types are string class array, basically data types that are more complex and need

a lot more space,
So let's say you go to a rental, so you want to get a car, right?

So you go to a car rental and then you are at the counter and you want to pick up the car that you have

ordered.

Well, the counter doesn't have your car, but it has the location of your car.

So it will give you the keys and it will tell you go this direction and you will find the car

CLR - COMMAN LANGUAGE RUNTIME


static simply means that this method
is static and it declares the static member, which belongs to the type itself rather than to a specific
object.
