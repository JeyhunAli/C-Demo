So what even is ASP.NET?
Well, it's an open source web framework for building
fast and secure web apps and services within.NET.
ASP.NET is also cross platform which is one of the biggest draws,
which means you can run it on Windows,
Linux, Mac OS, basically anywhere.
So this will allow you to build your
ASP.NET web apps on any operating system,
make websites with HTML, CSS,
or JavaScript and build
these web services to be used by your site or in mobile apps.
You can also turn your site sign into
popular third-party apps for authentication like Microsoft,
Google, Twitter and more.
ASP.NET lets you make your web pages with a language called razor.
Now razors cool because it's just HTML and C sharp.
So you can type HTML and then type
an at-sign and start writing C sharp.
We'll see some cool examples of this in this video series.
Best of all, ASP.NET is
absolutely free and if you're a student or doing open-source,
Visual Studio is also free.
In fact, everything we're going to show you
is free and all of.NET, C sharp,
and ASP.NET is open source and the code
is available on GitHub for you to read or learn from.

asp.net stands for active server pages which microsoft provides for building applications

differences between asp.net and asp.net core
applications built using asp.net can be
applicable only for windows
but applications using asp.net core can be
applicable for windows
linux and mac os asp.net uses
dotnet technology as the platform for
building the applications
where asp.net core uses both dotnet and
dot net core
as the platform for building
applications

the
performance of
applications using asp.net technology is 
good
whereas asp.net core applications have
high and better performance
